# PHP Projects #

This repo is a series of simple PHP projects that I have decided to do in order to learn some PHP.

I am using a tutorial on inLearning by Kevin Skoglund in order to learn.

These projects are all single-serving websites and they are all fairly esoteric.

## ipaddress.php ##

The IP address site simply returns the IP address of the client accessing the site. It is configured to return the forwarded address if the client is using a proxy and it validates that the IP address is in the right format and not restricted.
